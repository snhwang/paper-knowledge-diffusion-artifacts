r"""
run_sessions.py -- generate the panel sessions for the knowledge-diffusion paper.

Copy of bear-dev examples/bear_parlor/run_demo_session_v2.py. The two differ
only in this header and in how HERE is located (below); session logic is
identical.

WHAT IT RUNS
------------
8 topics x 3 conditions, every hat on one model:
  bear        each hat's diffusion uses its own BEAR lens instruction
  naive       every utterance stored verbatim, no lens
  wrong-lens  each hat's diffusion uses another hat's lens

Each session starts a BEAR Parlor server, plays the topic's scripted
facilitator prompts, ingests its three PDFs into White Hat, and shuts down.
Before each session, persisted panel memories/affinities are archived so no
session sees another's; afterwards, the state it created is saved beside its
logs.

WHERE THINGS LIVE
-----------------
The Parlor server (parlor.py, knowledge_rag.py), the source PDFs and the
instruction corpus it loads are in a bear-dev checkout, so this script drives
that directory. Default: <this repo>/../bear-dev/examples/bear_parlor.
Override with --parlor-dir PATH or the BEAR_PARLOR_DIR environment variable.
The instruction corpus in this repo (bear_parlor/instructions) must match the
one in bear-dev.

Logs are written to <parlor-dir>/session_logs/<log-subdir>/ (default v6). Copy
them into this repo's bear_parlor/session_logs/v6/ to analyse or archive them.

ENVIRONMENT (tested under WSL, Python 3.12)
-------------------------------------------
The repo's requirements.txt covers session generation. ChromaDB does not
import under Python 3.14, so use 3.10-3.13:
    uv venv .venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt

Exact tested versions: bear_parlor/requirements-sessions.lock.txt.

Mathpix credentials (MATHPIX_APP_ID, MATHPIX_APP_KEY) are read from bear-dev's
.env. Extracted PDF text is cached by file content, so each PDF is sent to
Mathpix once.

USAGE
-----
    cd /mnt/c/users/scott/documents/work/paper-knowledge-diffusion-artifacts
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # one session, to check the setup
    python bear_parlor/run_sessions.py --topics dmg --condition bear \
        --backend openai --model qwen3.8-flash-next \
        --base-url http://192.168.1.176:9010/v1 --api-key-env THEMINDFOLD_API_KEY

    # all 24 sessions (about 6 minutes each)
    python bear_parlor/run_sessions.py \
        --backend openai --model qwen3.8-flash-next \
        --base-url http://192.168.1.176:9010/v1 --api-key-env THEMINDFOLD_API_KEY

    # then verify every session used BEAR as described
    python evals/check_session_integrity.py \
        --dir ../bear-dev/examples/bear_parlor/session_logs/v6

--api-key-env names the ONE variable holding the model server's key; it is
read from the environment, bear-dev's .env or this repo's .env, and never
loads a whole .env file.
