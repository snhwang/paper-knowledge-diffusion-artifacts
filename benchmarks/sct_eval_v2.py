"""SCT-Bench evaluation v2: Aggregation-focused Six Thinking Hats panel.

Builds on sct_eval.py with key changes:
  - Blue hat participates as a VOTER only — no synthesis step
  - Multiple aggregation strategies: majority vote, median, trimmed mean
  - All 6 hats vote independently; aggregation is purely algorithmic
  - Preserves per-hat ratings for post-hoc analysis

Rationale (from v1 findings):
  In v1, the Blue hat synthesizer (0.625) performed significantly worse than
  both single-agent (0.698, p=0.036) and self-consistency (0.724, p=0.005).
  Panel majority (0.703) recovered most of the panel's value, and the panel
  oracle (0.888) showed substantial untapped signal. This script tests whether
  better aggregation can close the gap between majority and oracle.

Aggregation methods:
  - majority: Most common rating among valid votes (ties broken by first mode)
  - median:   Median of valid votes (rounded to nearest integer)
  - trimmed_mean: Drop highest and lowest vote, average the rest, round to
                  nearest valid rating (-2 to +2)
